## Problem 1

Let’s begin by loading in the data set.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

This data set has 358 observations of 15 variables. The variables
included in this data set are origin, year, month, day, hour, temp,
dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib,
time_hour. The mean temperature recorded in early January 2013 was 39.58
degrees.

Let’s create a scatterplot of time vs. temperature.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_nkr2121_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

We can see that the temperature steadily increased as the month
progressed. Humidity was also low in the beginning of the month, and
slowly increased as well.

Now, I will save the scatter plot as a PNG file.

``` r
ggsave('weather_scatter.png')
```

## Problem 2

Creating the dataframe:

``` r
set.seed(1234)

hw1_df = 
  tibble(
    sample = rnorm(n = 10),
    vec_logical = sample > 0,
    vec_character = c("A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A", "B", "C", "A"),
    vec_factor = factor(vec_character)
  )
```

Now attempting to take the `mean` of `sample`, `vec_logical`,
`vec_character`, and `vec_factor`:

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, sample))
```

    ## [1] -0.3831574

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_character)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

As evident by the error messages we get for the last 2, you can take the
mean of numeric or logical variables, but none of the other kinds of
variables.

Now, I will try applying the `as.numeric()` function to the
`vec_logical`, `vec_character`, and `vec_factor` variables:

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))

as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_character))

as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor))
```

And then, will subsequently try taking the `mean` of these `as.numeric`
conversions:

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical)))

mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_character)))

mean(as.numeric(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)))
```

The logical vector is able to be converted to a numeric variable by
assigning 0’s and 1’s based on TRUE or FALSE status. The character
vector is not able to be converted to a numeric variable, because the
characters do not correspond to any numbers that R is able to read.
However, the factor variable is able to be converted to a numeric
variable, because the factors have corresponding levels, and those
levels (3 factor levels in this case) can those levels are what R uses
to convert the variable into a numeric variable.
